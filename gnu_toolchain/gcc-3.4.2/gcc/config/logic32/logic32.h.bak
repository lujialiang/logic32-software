/* A C expression which is nonzero if a function must have and use a frame
   pointer.  This expression is evaluated in the reload pass.  If its value is
   nonzero the function will have a frame pointer.

   The expression can in principle examine the current function and decide
   according to the facts, but on most machines the constant 0 or the constant
   1 suffices.  Use 0 when the machine allows code to be generated with no
   frame pointer, and doing so saves some time or space.  Use 1 when there is
   no possible advantage to avoiding a frame pointer.

   In certain cases, the compiler does not know how to produce valid code
   without a frame pointer.  The compiler recognizes those cases and
   automatically gives the function a frame pointer regardless of what
   `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' says.  You don't need to worry about them.

   In a function that does not require a frame pointer, the frame pointer

   describes the declaration of the function.  From this it is possible to

   FUNTYPE is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes the
